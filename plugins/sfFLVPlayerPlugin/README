sfFLVPlayer plugin
===================

The **sfFLVPlayerPlugin** is a symfony plugin that provides a player for flash "flv" movies. The player has been developed by Neolao and is available at [flv-player.net](http://flv-player.net/). Neolao provides several players. We choose to implement the [MULTI](http://flv-player.net/players/multi/) version, which is the most complete version. This version supports playlists.
